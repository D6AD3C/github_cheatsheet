# GITHUB CheatSheet

## Have GITHUB not dox you
Git remote likes to randomly dox you by using whatever username and email it feels like storing globally. Change this here: 
C:\Users\USERNAME\\.gitconfig

## Pull from GITHUB remote
git clone https://github.com/id/repo.git

## Push to GITHUB remote
git add .
git commit -m "update"
git push -u origin main
